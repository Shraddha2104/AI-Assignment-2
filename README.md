# AI-Assignment-2- HALMA

## Synopsis

This project was completed as a part of my coursework for the course CSCI 561: Foundations in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Southern California, Fall 2019.

## Description
In this project, we will play the game of Halma, an adversarial game with some similarities to checkers. The game uses a 16x16 checkered gameboard. Each player starts with 19 game pieces clustered in diagonally opposite corners of the board. To win the game, a player needs to transfer all of their pieces from their starting corner to the opposite corner, into the positions that were initially occupied by the opponent. Note that this original rule of the game is subject to spoiling, as a player may choose to not move some pieces at all, thereby preventing the opponent from occupying those locations. Note that the spoiling player cannot win either (because some pieces remain in their original corner and thus cannot be used to occupy all positions in the opposite corner). Here, to prevent spoiling, we modify the goal of the game to be to occupy all of the opponentâ€™s starting positions which the opponent is not still occupying.
